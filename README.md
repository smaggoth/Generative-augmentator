# 🐾 Generative Augmentator

**Generative Augmentator** is a prototype designed to generate a solid and generalized image database starting from just a few reference images. By processing user-uploaded images with **evolutionary techniques**, the system expands a small sample size into a diverse dataset capable of training high-accuracy classifiers.

## 🚀 Overview

Training deep learning models often requires thousands of images. This tool bridges the gap by:
1. Identifying the **main characteristics** of a base image (e.g., a cat).
2. Applying **evolutive processing** to create variations.
3. Generating a complete, synthetic dataset ready for classification tasks.



## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Run the Code:** Execute the main script in your Python environment.
2. **Adjust Hyperparameters:** Fine-tune the **StyleGAN** parameters to match your specific quality and diversity requirements.
3. **Upload Base Image:** Provide the model with any image (like a cat) and watch the generative "magic" happen.

## 📈 Features

* **Data Scarcity Solution:** Build a robust database from a single starting point.
* **StyleGAN Integration:** High-fidelity image synthesis.
* **Evolutionary Logic:** Ensures the generated data is diverse enough to prevent overfitting.
